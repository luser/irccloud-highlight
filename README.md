This user script implements a highlights buffer for [irccloud](https://www.irccloud.com/). The highlights window for each connection collects all the highlight messages you receive in that connection.

[Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luser/irccloud-highlight/master/irccloud_highlights.user.js) to install the script using GreaseMonkey.

Known bugs:
* A private message buffer named `highlights` will show up if you reload. You can delete it and things should work fine.
